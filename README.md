# Little-Sicilys-Pizza
Simple Website Design

I found a website from a mom and pop pizzeria (http://www.littlesicilys.com/), and I remade thier website. I used the Italian Flag as a background, and within the white space I have a the important information in a one page design. I needed to use javascript to use a slideshow with thumbnails and captions. I did not use bootstrap. Of course, I used html, css, and javascript.
